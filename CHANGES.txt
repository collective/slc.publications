Changelog
---------

1.1.16 (2010-06-09)
-------------------

- Bugfix in publication view: don't show links to translations which the user
  may not see (thomasw)

1.1.15 (2009-03-03)
-------------------

- bugfix: file_view creates a folder to hold extra data such as Link
  objects pointing to chapters in the pdf file. Now bypassing security
  checks so that this will also be created when an Anonymous user
  views the publication (deroiste)
- bugfix: BaseAttributeExtractor was defined incorrectly for the case that slc.xliff is not installed (thomasw)


1.1.14 (2009-12-07)
-------------------

- Refined overrides.zcml. It will now also work with newer plone.app.blob
  versions and images in blob. (gerken)
- Change related publications boxes to "key resources" (manually added) and "related resources" (Keyword based) Change requested by Sarah during Bilbao meeting 30.11-1.12.2009  #439 (pilz)
- Added EUPL license (deroiste)


1.1.13 (2009-11-09)
-------------------

- removed unnecessary reference to OSHA in subtyper/publication.py (thomasw)
- typo in FR translation (thomasw)
- added possibility to display additional info on the view of a publication via an adapter (thomasw)

1.1.12 (2009-10-18)
-------------------

-translate the contents of the author field - workaround since the field is language-independent (thomasw)

1.1.11 (2009-10-14)
-------------------

- rerelease. There was a mistake where parts of the package did not get into the egg

1.1.10 (2009-10-13)
-------------------

- fixed an inconsistency in the related publications where language indepentent was not used (pilz)
- replaced all occurences of i18n:translate in the publication_view template 
  with a call to a method on the view that uses MessageFactory. I couldn't figure
  out why i18n:translate worked for some langs, and not for others such as NL (thomasw)



1.1.9 (2009-10-06)
------------------
- Chapter links now always point to the url. Normally, if you click on a link
  and you have edit rights, you would go to the link view and not to the link 
  target. Since we already offer a second edit link, when somebody has edit 
  rights, the regular link can point directly to the place the link points to. 
  (gerken)

- Refactored the Chapter Update functionality. It is not a method any longer
  but a class. That way one can modify the behaviour without the need to
  copy the complete functionality (gerken)

1.1.8 (2009-09-30)
------------------
- Hide the JS-scanner induced PDF icon from the Related publications list on the publication's view (jcbrand)

------------------

- Add remove_additionals event handler in adapter/events.py and register it via zcml for IObjectRemovedEvent (jcbrand)
- Edited the object_added event: removed the code that sets translation
  references, it has been superseded by slc.autotranslate. (jcbrand)
- Removed _findAbbrev in adapter/events.py, it's no longer being called (jcbrand)
- Added a new doctest file events.txt to test for the above actions. (jcbrand)

1.1.5 (2009-08-13)
------------------

- enhanced setuphandlers.py (together with import_steps.xml and config.py) to automatically install dependencies. (jcbrand)
- remove explicit blob checking in adapter/publication.py and instead do it via zcml, i.e zcml:condition="installed plone.app.blob" (jcbrand)
- modified addTranslation patch to return the translated item as is done in of LinguaPlone >= 2.3 (jcbrand)
