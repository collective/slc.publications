        <div class="documentDescription">The Publication Product can be used to organise printed publications that are available online for download. Publications usually have a publication date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions. Once stored in the Publication Product, they can be displayed using autogenerated overviews. Support is built in for easy upload and parsing of metadata.</div>

                <div id="bodyContent">

<p>If you want to add publications, you need to add a "Publication Folder" first. The Publication Folder is used to represent a section of publications. It provides a special view to display a list of its contained publications together with an image and a language box to quickly download a publication in a specific language. For the content editor it provides a facility to quickly upload several publications using the bulk uploader. Each uploaded folder with pdf files is thereby converted to a publication object.</p>
<div align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="pubfolderview.png" alt="Publication Folder View" /><br /><em>Publication folder view</em></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inside the folder, you can add "Publication" objects. Each Publication object represents one publication and stores metadata about that publication like Title, Description, Publication date and Author. It provides a detailed view on that publication containing all available metainformation. It also contains a quick upload feature to quickly upload the publication pdf files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img class="image-inline" src="pubview.png" alt="Publication view" /></p>
<p align="center"><em>Publication detail view</em></p>
<p>The PDF Files of a Publication are stored as "Publication File" objects inside the Publication object. Each Publication File represents one language version.&nbsp; As there are some metadata like Title, Description, ISBN or order number specific to the language version of the publication, these are stored on the Publication File object. The user will normally not see the Publication file directly, though.</p>
<p>The Publication object acts as a dispatcher between the user and the Publication File. If the user accesses a publication, it fetches the appropriate publication file based on the users preferred language and displays the metadata of that publication file to the user. If a user accesses the same publication using the same url but a different preferred language, the publication will be displayed in the other language. If some metadata is not available in the requested language, the metadata from the publication object is used as fallback.</p>

                    Working with publications
                </h1>

                <div class="documentDescription">This section describes the ways how you add publications to your site</div>

                <div id="bodyContent">


<p>First, you need to find out whether you want to have one or multiple sections for your publications. If you don't have many publications, one Publication Folder may be the best solution. If you have reports, magazines, fact sheets, proceedings, etc., your might consider adding one Publication Folder for each of those types.</p>
<ul><li>Add a Publication Folder<br /></li></ul>
<p>Now we can add publications to the folder.</p>
<p><strong>There is the manual way</strong></p>
<ul><li>Add a Publication</li><li>Fill in the edit form and save</li><li>Add a Publication File inside the Publication</li><li>Fill in the edit form and select a PDF File for upload<br /></li></ul>
<p>If you want to add more publications to your site, you probably have one or
more folders on your desktop containing the PDF files of your
publications. In this case you might want to try the semi automatic way.</p>
<p><strong>Semi-automatic way</strong></p>

<ul><li>Organize your pdf files to that all pdfs of a publication are placed in a folder named after the publication. In case you have multiple language PDFs, make sure that they start or end with a language abbreviation to allow autodetection of the language (e.g. EN_report.pdf or report_EN.pdf).<br /></li><li>You can have multiple folders representing one publication each; each containing several language versions as PDF files.</li><li>Click on edit and select the upload section; The bulk upload java applet loads.</li><li>Drag the folders onto the applet and send them.</li></ul>
<p>Now, each folder will be converted to a publication object and the PDF files inside will become Publication files.</p>
<p>If you want the system to autodetect metainformation, click on edit and parse to automatically parse all files. This step will also check the filename for hints to the PDF's language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    Metadata
                </h1>

                <div class="documentDescription">How metadata is used on the publications and how you can set and edit them.</div>

                <div id="bodyContent">

<p>If you access a publication folder or object through the web, instead of being presented the whole publication PDF for download, you will first see a short description of the publications metadata as a preview.</p>
<ul><li>On the Publication Folder you will see Title, Description, Image and language versions for each publication in the folder.</li></ul>
<ul><li>On the Publication itself, you will see Title, Description, Image, language versions, ISBN and order number, Author and Publication date. You might even see additional keywords or related publications there.</li></ul>
<h3>Parsing PDF files</h3>

<p>PDFs have the possibility of storing metadata. If you have stored metadata on your pdfs, the publication product can try to parse them and set those information automatically on the objects. The following PDF metadata attributes are supported:</p>
<ul><li>Title</li><li>Description</li><li>Language</li><li>Keywords</li><li>Contributors</li><li>Modification Date</li><li>Expiration Date</li><li>Effective Date</li><li>Rights</li><li>Publisher</li><li>Format</li></ul>
<p>You also can manually set the following attribute on a PDF file and it will be recognized:</p>
<ul><li>OPOCE (to store an european bookshop order number)</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have attributes set on your PDF file, you can tell the system to parse them.</p>
<ul><li>On a Publication File object, click edit and check the "parse" checkbox. Click save to parse.</li><li>On a Publication object, click edit and parse, then check the "parse" checkbox and click save to parse. Note that now all contained language version PDFs will be parsed.</li><li>On a Publication Folder object, click edit and parse, then check the "parse" checkbox and click save to
parse. Note that now all contained publication object including their language version PDFs will be parsed.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Uploading a Metadata config file</h3>
<p>If you don't have metadata set on your pdf file, it can be annoying to click through a lot of edit forms to set metatada manually. Especially if you have many language versions to take care of. In this case it can be helpful to collect all metadata in a single textfile and upload that to the system. You can do that in the upload section of the edit form of the publication object.</p>
<p>The text file consists of one [default] section and several language sections, named by the language abbreviation ([en], [de], ...). Below each section you can specify the attribute names and their values separated by a colon (':'). If an attribute should be stored as list, you can append square brackets to the end of the attribute name ('[]') so that the system knows that it should parse the value as a list, where the values are separated by commas (',').</p>

                <div class="documentDescription">How to translate publication metadata.</div>

                <div id="bodyContent">


<p>There are several methods to translate the metadata, all depending on how your process of adding the publication is organised.</p>
<ul><li>Of course you can add the translations manually.</li><li>If you have control over the creation process of your PDF files, you can add the translated texts already to the metadata of the PDF files. This is the smartest way because then these metadata will still be assiciated with the publication PDF, even if the user has downloaded it and saved it on his computer.</li><li>If you don't have the metadata set on the PDF files directly, you can create a text file with the metadata in one language and have this section duplicated and translated to the other languages. Then, upload the text file to the system.</li><li>If you have installed the XLIFF AddOn, you can generate an XLIFF representation of the publications and have them translated.</li></ul>
