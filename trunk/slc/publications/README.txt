Publication Product

  The Publication Product can be used to organise printed publications that are
  available online for download. Such Publications usually have a publication
  date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions.

  Once stored in the Publication Product, they can be displayed using
  autogenerated overviews.

Installation

  * Requires 

    - p4a.subtyper, p4a.common, p4a.z2utils

    - archetypes.schemaextender

    - LinguaPlone (the product might run without but I have not bothered to make the calls to LP conditional yet...)

  * Install egg (see slc.publications egg documentation).
  
  * Create a file called ``slc.publications-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="slc.publications" />

  * use the QuickInstaller to add this product to your Plone site

  * Optional: pdfinfo to parse pdf metadata (part of the xpdf package)

  * Optional: pdftk and imagemagicks convert to generate a 
    cover image from a pdf file

Translations

  Note that the ATCT file object by default has a languageIndependent file
  attribute. That means that you can translate the Title and Description of a
  file object but not change the real file. Publications changes this behaviour
  for ATCT and Blob files. 

Documentation

  See the **doc** directory in this package.
