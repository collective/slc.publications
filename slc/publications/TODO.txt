TODO
====

- Once a folder or file has been changed to be a publication type, it doesn't 
  show the archetype tabs anymore. Any additional attributes but the ones 
  defined for the publication are no longer accessible
  
- Edit interface cleanup: We need a quicker way to add chapters.

- i18n cleanup

- add the image auto generation

- add the related publications section

- metadata export needs to be restricted on relevant attributes. (i.e. id  or remoteUrl is unnecessary, but how do I get schemaextended attribs?)

- Review the PDF Parser. There are still other formats in PDF Files, we do not
  cover all of them. Find out why.
