TODO
====

- i18n cleanup

- add the related publications section

- metadata export needs to be restricted on relevant attributes. (i.e. id  or remoteUrl is unnecessary, but how do I get schemaextended attribs?)

- Review the PDF Parser. There are still other formats in PDF Files, we do not
  cover all of them. Find out why.

- Improve support for bulkuploading files. If I upload files into a publication folder, I want them to be subtyped to publications automatically. If I upload multiple files that have a language abbreviation, I want them to be glued together to form the translation relation.
