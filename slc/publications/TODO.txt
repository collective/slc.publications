TODO

- Currently the chapter links while translating are not set immediately onto the
translation. You need to save once again. Find out why.

- Review the permissions

- Review the PDF Parser. There are still other formats in PDF Files, we do not
  cover all of them. Find out why.

- DONE: metadata.ini support for chapter links
