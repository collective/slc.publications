TODO
====

- i18n cleanup

- reshen up the skinworks

- add the related publications section

- metadata export needs to be restricted on relevant attributes. (i.e. id  or remoteUrl is unnecessary, but how do I get schemaextended attribs? - perhaps use the same adapter mechanism as with slc.xliff...)

- Review the PDF Parser. There are still other formats in PDF Files, we do not
  cover all of them. Find out why.

Potential Risk
--------------

- The mechanism to place the country abbrevs as sections into the ini files is hardcoded to 2 letter abbrevs. What if someone uses de-de as code? Need to make this rely on the language tool completely
