TODO
====

    - i18n cleanup
    
    - there is no way currently to start parsing the pdf.
    
    - metadata export needs to be restricted on relevant attributes. (i.e. 
      id  or remoteUrl is unnecessary, but how do I get schemaextended 
      attribs? - perhaps use the same adapter mechanism as with slc.xliff...)
    
    - Review the PDF Parser. There are still other formats in PDF Files, we 
      do not cover all of them. Find out why.
      
    - After bulk uploading e.g. by flash uploader, one may want to 
      automatically parse all or certain files for pdf properties. It could 
      be interesting to add that possibility to the folder.

    - Currently we cannot reliably detect the language of an uploaded file by 
      file extension. 

Potential Risk
--------------

    - The mechanism to place the country abbrevs as sections into the ini 
      files is hardcoded to 2 letter abbrevs. What if someone uses de-de as 
      code? Need to make this rely on the language tool completely
