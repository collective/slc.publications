PDF Parser
==========

slc.publications comes with a component to parse pdf file metadata. It does that using the pyxml and pdftk tools. If you pass it a pdf file it will try to extract the available metadata and provide a dictionary in return.

Note: Make sure "pdfinfo" is in the path of your zope user and is callable.

First we need a pdf file to parse. We load a demonstration pdf file from doc/UsingthePublicationProduct.pdf which has the following metadata set within the pdf file:

    - Title: Using the Publication Product
    - Description: The Publication Product can be used ...
    - Keywords: documentation, tutorial
    - Language: en

    >>> docpdf = self.loadDocumentation()
    
Then we get the parser utility.
    
    >>> from zope.component import getUtility
    >>> from slc.publications.pdf.interfaces import IPDFParser
    >>> pdfparser = getUtility(IPDFParser)

Now we can retrieve the metadata by calling the parse method.

    >>> metadata = pdfparser.parse(docpdf.getvalue())
    >>> metadata is not False
    True
    >>> metadata['title'].startswith('Using the Publication Product')
    True
    >>> metadata['description'].startswith('The Publication Product can be used')
    True
    >>> metadata['keywords']
    ('documentation', 'tutorial')
    >>> metadata['language']
    'en'
