Publication Product
===================

The Publication Product can be used to organise printed publications that are available online for download. Such Publications usually have a publication date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions. Once stored in the Publication Product, they can be displayed using autogenerated overviews.

Note that the ATCT file object by default has a languageIndependent file attribute. That means that you can translate the Title and Description of a file object but not change the real file. Publications changes this behaviour for ATCT and Blob files.
