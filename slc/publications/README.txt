Publication Product
===================

The Publication Product can be used to organise printed publications that are available online for download. Such Publications usually have a publication date, order and ISBN numbers, an author and exist in several language versions. Once stored in the Publication Product, they can be displayed using autogenerated overviews. 


Installation
------------

  * Requires 
 
    - On Plone2.5: AdvancedQuery (http://www.dieter.handshake.de/pyprojects/zope/#AdvancedQuery) 
      (thanks to Alin Voinea for pointing that out)

    - xpath that comes with pyxml

  * Put this package in your Zope's Products directory and restart Zope

  * use the QuickInstaller to add this product to your Plone site

  * Optional: pdfinfo to parse pdf metadata (part of the xpdf package)

  * Optional: pdftk and imagemagicks convert to generate a 
    cover image from a pdf file

Translations
------------
Note that the ATCT file object by default has a languageIndependent file attribute. That means that you can translate the Title and Description of a file object but not change the real file. Publications changes this behaviour for ATCT and Blob files. 

LinguaPlone is patched
----------------------

the file linguaplone_addTranslation_patch patches linguaplones addTranslation method.
It simply adds a new event that is thrown after a translation is created but before 
its data is set. This is necessary because on translation we need to subtype before we
can set any data, otherwise the schema will not be extended.

Documentation
-------------
See the *doc* directory in this package.
